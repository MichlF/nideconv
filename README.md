# Nideconv
nideconv is a Python module for fast and easy estimating of event-related signals. 

# Installation
Currently, nideconv can be installed using the GitHub repository:

### Make Conda environment (optional but highly reccomended, especially for Windows)
I highly reccomend to first make a dedicated [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)-environment:

`conda create --name nideconv`

Then activate that environment
`conda activate nideconv`

Install requirements
`conda create install numpy scikit-learn pystan`

And install nideconv itself
`pip install git+https://github.com/VU-Cog-Sci/nideconv`

### Install nideconv without  
It is very important that you have Cython and numpy before you install, so do
`pip install cython numpy`

And then install Nideconv itself
`pip install git+https://github.com/VU-Cog-Sci/nideconv`
